# Data Structures Practicals 
## C++ (Semester Practical Files)
---------------------------------------------------------
Files included:
avl.cpp, bst.cpp, circular_linked_list.cpp, doubly_linked_list.cpp, queue.cpp, singly_linked_list.cpp, stack_evaluation.cpp
- Makefile to compile quick demos (use `make` or individual targets)
- Each cpp file contains a demo in main() that prints sample terminal output.

How I validated:
- Each file was compiled with: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2
- The produced executables were run to capture the demo output below.
- If a file failed to compile, the error is shown below instead of run output.
